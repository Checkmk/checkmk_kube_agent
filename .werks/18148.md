Previously, the Pods of `node-collector-container-metrics` would process metric such as `container_referenced_bytes`, which resulted in errors such as
```
W0725 09:09:14.326558       1 handler.go:426] Cannot read smaps files for any PID from CONTAINER
```
With this Werk, only metrics with the option parameter `cpu` and `memory` are processed. See [Prometheus container metrics](https://github.com/google/cadvisor/blob/master/docs/storage/prometheus.md) for documentation on option parameters.
