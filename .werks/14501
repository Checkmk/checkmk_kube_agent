Title: irrelevant sections cause machine sections collector to CrashLoopBackOff

The machine sections node collector runs into a CrashLoopBackOff without any
helpful error message, other than "RuntimeError: Agent execution failed". This
has been fixed.

The reason for this was that some sections, which were not relevant for the
host, returned a non-zero exit code.
