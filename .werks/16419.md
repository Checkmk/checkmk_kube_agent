For Kubernetes clusters running a IPv6/IPv4 dual stack, the node collectors would display the
following error:

```
File "/home/solo/git/checkmk_kube_agent/.venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/requests/sessions.py", line 794, in get_adapter
    raise InvalidSchema(f"No connection adapters were found for {url!r}")
requests.exceptions.InvalidSchema: No connection adapters were found for '::'
```

This has been fixed.

Moreover, the cluster collector was hardcoded to bind to a socket with address family AF_INET. This
is now configurable with the values.yaml file via the option '.clusterCollector.address'.
