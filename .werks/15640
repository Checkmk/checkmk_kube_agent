The `Filesystem` service reports information about the container of the
node-collector rather than the host machine. In most cases, this results in the
desired monitoring. But in some cases, it is desirable to monitor a volume
mount other than the ones the CRI mounts by default.

Since our monitoring depends on calls to `statfs`, it is necessary to mount at least one file from
any file system that needs monitoring. One way of achieving this is by installing the
machine-sections directly on the host machines. However, this means the node-collectors are no
longer containerized.

With this Werk, the file system of the host machine can be mounted into the container by configuring
the `values.yaml`.
