Title: Fix Don't Deadlock if OS.PIPE Overflows

The machine-sections-collector executes a version of the 'check_mk_agent' to collect information
about the host. Previously, if the script produced output to the extent that it had to wait for the
OS pipe buffer to accept more data, it would cause the machine-sections-collector to deadlock and
eventually the collector would timeout. This issue has now been fixed.
