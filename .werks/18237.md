In larger Kubernetes environments, the component experienced OOMKilled events due to insufficient memory allocation.
The previous default resource limit of 200Mi memory was too restrictive for environments with substantial cluster
resources, and higher CPU limits were also needed in some cases.

The default resource requests and limits have been removed from the deployment configuration.
This allows Kubernetes administrators to set appropriate resource constraints based on their specific cluster size
and requirements, rather than using fixed defaults that may not suit all environments.
