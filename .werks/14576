When installing or upgrading the chart, you can pass <tt>-f values.yaml</tt> to overwrite default
values of the chart specified in your custom values.yaml file. However, this would result in a
different logging level for the node collectors. With this werk, logging is set to warning when
using <tt>-f values.yaml</tt>.
