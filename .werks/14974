Title: Long-lived API token for "checkmk" ServiceAccount for Kubernetes version >= 1.24
Class: fix

The "checkmk" ServiceAccount is used to access the Kubernetes collectors and
the Kubernetes API from the Checkmk monitoring server. This ServiceAccount also
needs an access token in order to authenticate against these components.

Since Kubernetes version 1.24, ServiceAccounts are no longer automatically
assigned a token. Upon deploying the "checkmk" helm chart, we suggested
creating the token via the "kubectl create token" command. However, this method
does not create long-lived ServiceAccount tokens and was not a suitable method.
We now create the token using a dedicated manifest.
