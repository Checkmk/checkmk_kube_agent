    """Thread-safe deduplicating TTL cache.

    WARNING: This code requires Python >= 3.7 to work.

    Deduplication is achieved by overwriting existing entries that are to be
    deduplicated with the new value when `put` is called.

    The key of the entry that signals its unique identity is determined by a
    key function, specified by the `key` argument.

    When provided with a `maxsize`, any entry added that causes the cache to
    grow beyond this size will lead to the oldest entry to be discarded from
    the cache.

    When provided with a `ttl` (time to live in seconds), entries that exceed
    this age are not returned by `get_all` or `get` methods, and are removed
    from the cache eventually.

    It is not recommended to change `maxsize` or `ttl` during operation.
    Do so at your own risk.

    Examples:

        >>> c = DedupTTLCache(key=lambda x: x[0], maxsize=2, ttl=2*60)
        >>> c.put(("foo", "bar"))
        >>> c.put(("foo", "bar"))
        >>> c
        DedupTTLCache({'foo': ('foo', 'bar')}, maxsize=2, currsize=1)

        >>> c.put(("bar", "foo"))
        >>> c.put(("baz", "foo"))
        >>> c
        DedupTTLCache({'bar': ('bar', 'foo'), 'baz': ('baz', 'foo')}, maxsize=2, currsize=2)

        >>> c.get_all()
        [('bar', 'foo'), ('baz', 'foo')]
